This is just a small Brainfuck interpreter written in Ruby.

Run it:
./bf.rb yourcode.b

If you want to run Brainfuck code from your own Ruby programm,
take a look at bflib.rb.

You'll need the highline gem. You should get it by typing:
$ sudo gem install highline 

This code using ruby 1.9(.1) just because it's faster ;)
